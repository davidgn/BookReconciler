# BookReconciler 📘💎 — Metadata Enrichment and Work-Level Clustering

- **Who is this for?** Digital humanities researchers, librarians, metadata specialists, and more.
- **What does it do?** Finds, clusters, and enriches records for books. Adding ISBNS, HathiTrust IDs, subject headings, descriptions, page counts, publication dates, and more.

**BookReconciler 📘💎** is a tool that helps you reconcile and enrich bibliographic data from multiple library and knowledge sources:

1. **Library of Congress**
2. **Google Books**
3. **OCLC / WorldCat**
4. **HathiTrust**
5. **VIAF**
6. **Wikidata**
7. **OpenLibrary**

You can take a spreadsheet with only title and author information, and you can add identifiers like **ISBNs**, **OCLC numbers**, or **HathiTrust Volume IDs**, as well as valuable contextual information like Library of Congress **Subject Headings**, **genres**, **descriptions**, **page counts**, and **dates of first publicatio**n. Additionally, you can find and cluster different editions or manifestations of the same _Work_ (e.g., translations, reprints, etc.).

![](images/bookreconociler-logo-ps-white.png)

The tool currently works as an extension of the software application **[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/)**, which makes it accessible to those with and without computational experience. It includes a user-friendly, human-in-the-loop interface for manually evaluating matches, defining _Works_ (e.g., whether to include translations or not), and configuring the behavior of the service (e.g., matching all possible editions or just the best one).

The tool can also serve as a **bridge to computational text analysis**. A HathiTrust Volume ID can be used to computationally access the full text (for public domain works) or "bags of words" (for in-copyright works) for any text that is held by the HathiTrust Digital Library. This enable users to move from metadata to full computational text analysis. To learn more about accessing full text with Volume IDs, see the [HathiTrust Feature Reader](https://github.com/htrc/htrc-feature-reader?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) Python package.

<br>

If you'd rather not use Docker, you can follow these steps.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- macOS / Linux / Windows

### 1) Clone this GitHub repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org-or-user>/openrefine-reconciliation-service.git
cd openrefine-reconciliation-service
```

### 2) Create a virtual environment (recommended but not required)

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3) Install required packages

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4) Start the server, which runs the BookReconciler tool

```bash
# Tell Flask which app to run
export FLASK_APP=app.py          # Windows PowerShell: $env:FLASK_APP="app.py"

# Start BookReconciler on port 5001
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5001
# (Optional during development) add --debug to auto-reload on file changes:
# flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5001 --debug
```

When it starts, the service will be available at:

- **Browser User Interface (for configuration):** <http://127.0.0.1:5001/>
- **OpenRefine endpoint:** <http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/v1/reconcile>

# Basic Usage

1. Open your dataset/project in OpenRefine.
2. Click a column you want to reconcile—for example, the book "title" column.
3. Choose **Reconcile → Start reconciling…**
   ![](images/start-reconciling.png)
4. Click **Add Standard Service**.
   ![](images/add-service.png)
5. Paste the service URL for BookReconciler, which will connect you with Library of Congress, Wikidata, Google Books, and more:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/v1/reconcile
   ```

6. Select a reconciliation type (e.g., `LC_Work_Id`, `OCLC_Record`, `HathiTrust`, `VIAF_Personal`, `VIAF_Title`, `Wikidata_Title`).
7. Optionally, add "Additional Properties," like the author's name, which may help improve match performance.
   ![](images/additional-properties.png)
8. Click **Start Reconciling**.
9. Wait for reconciliation to complete. This can take seconds to hours depending on the number of values. Then, inspect matches.
   ![](images/inspect.png)
10. Lastly, add new values—ISBNs, Subject Headings, Descriptions, etc.—based on matches. Select Edit Column -> Add columns from reconciled values...
    ![](images/add.png)
    Choose the values that you want to add from "Suggested Properties" (possible values are different for each service).

# Acknowledgments

This project was initially supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), ["Post45 Data Collective: Enhancing Cultural Data Documentation, Interoperability, and Reach,"](https://apps.neh.gov/publicquery/AwardDetail.aspx?gn=HAA-301046-24) and led by co-PIs Dan Sinykin and Melanie Walsh. The grant was slated to run from 2024-2026, but it was [abruptly cancelled](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/07/nx-s1-5495365/neh-national-endowment-for-the-humanities-lawsuit) in spring 2025.

We are grateful to the Post45 Data Collective editorial board and to Juan Pablo Albornoz, Jen Doty, Sanghoon Oh, and Teddy Roland for early testing and feedback.
